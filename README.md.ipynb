    "## Carnd - term 2 - project 2 - unscented kalman filter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build an unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) model to process a series of sensor data provided by radar and lidar. Similar to Porject 1, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) model, same source of radar and lidar data is used. \n",
    "The UKF model is conected to the same simulator via uWebSocketIO.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Repository\n",
    "All resource are located in Udacity's project repository\n",
    "[CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Submission\n",
    "All modified code including results are committed to my personal github page\n",

    "### Key Files\n",
    "##### main.cpp\n",
    "establishes communication between simulator and UKF model using uWebSocketIO, and reads in data during set time interval and send sensor measurements to UKF::ProcessMeasurement() in ukp.cpp for processing \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ukf.cpp\n",
    "contains 4 main functions: UKF::ProcessMeasurement(), UKF::Prediction(), UKF::UpdateLidarUKF(), UKF::UpdataRadar().\n",
    "\n",
    "UKF::ProcessMeasurement() initializes state x_ and process covariance matrix P_ based on sensor data stypes: radar vs lidar. After initalization, delta time and meas_package will be fed to UKF::Prediction() for corresponding sigma point generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "UKF::Prediction() generates sigma points X_ base on x_ and P_. Then follow by generating augmented sigma points Xsig_aug withing adding acceleration noise std_a_ and radial acceleration noise std_yawdd_ to existing process covariance matrix, becoming P_aug. Then, using function h(s, noise) to transform Xsig_aug predicted sigma points, Xsig_pred. Form Xsig_pred, we applied weighted summation to its sigma points to calcalate the predicted mean x_, (xk+1|k), and predicted covariance matrix P\\_, (Pk+1|k).\n",
    "\n",
    "UKF::UpdateRadar() uses state transaction function h(x) to transform Xsig_pred into predicted measurement points Zsig. From Zsig, applies weighted summation to extract predicted measurement mean, z_pred. With the weighted summation of different between Zsig_pred and z_pred, and the noise of radar equipment, we calculates measurement covariance matrix, S. Then using S, we determines cross-correlation matrix, T, and calcaulted Kalman gain matrix, Kag. With T and Kag, state x\\_ and  process covariance P\\_ is updated with the new state and covariance. At the end, Normalized Innovation Square, NIS, is calculated to verify consistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "UKF::UpdateLidarUKF() uses the same method as UpdateRadar, but instead of using the state transition function h(x) that composes of a 3-dimensional function for rho, phi, and rhorate, the h(x) is replaced with a 2-dimensional function for px\\_ and py\\_. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "If radar measurement input if received, use the rho, phi, and rhodot measurement to update state vector x\\_. Otherwise, lidar measurement is straightforward to use px\\_ and py\\_ directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction\n",
    "Prediction applies to both Radar and Lidar the same way as so each out. No different thread is needed to decide . TOne thing to look for is DO NOT attempt to normailzed angelse at sigma point creation. Will discuss more in later parallal.   \n",

    "### Normalizing Phi Angle\n",
    "It is crucial to normalize phi angle in the range between pi and -pi. The explanation had been discussed previously in Project 1. Here for unscented Kalman Filter, phi angle is normailzed every time there is a subtration on the angle, normalization should take place to ensure the range of turning can only goes from 90 degree from the center (straight) to the left(-) and to the right(+).  [Here](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/ekf-gets-off-track/276122/19?u=drivewell)\n",

    "## Result\n",
    "Initial bring up of the code is short as I am using the old code structure from project 1. At the beginning, I got green tracker faulty mapped the estimation and pediction with bumps (off tracked) around 160 and 350 time stamps. As I observed, the calculated state x_ and covariance state matrix were increasing exponentially as raw measurement data was being processed. The problem was normalizing phi angles at sigma points generations and predicting Xaug_pred. It was a coding bug that normalization was not applied to the first sigma point phi but the rest of the sigma points, and causing an inconsistency in phi angles.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After removing the unnecessary phi normalization, the estimation (green tracker) was able to follow the tail of the car properly. Another bug discovered was caused by std_a and std_yawdd_ being too larger for bicycle database. After multiple attempts to adjust the noise, I settled to the following. I also chose to initialize P\\_ matrix to zero except P\\_(0,0)=1 and P\\_(1,1)=1. This gave me a better result on RMSE. But sure there is room to improve. \n",
